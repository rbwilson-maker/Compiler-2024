// "An odd case arises when there is no control flow path connecting the use of
//  a variable to its declaration. In L1, this can arise when a return
//  statement separates the declaration of a variable from its use. In such a
//  case, the variable need not be initialized. However, each variable must
//  still be declared and the use lie in the scope of the declaration."
//  This test case exercises that check.
