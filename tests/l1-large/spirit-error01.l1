    The Notolab score is your final score, for grading purposes.  We'd like you
    to write interesting tests, though, which will help both you and your
    classmates throughout the semester. An interesting test is not necessarily a
    hard or long test, but rather one that computes something interesting (thus
    exercising the compiler's functionality in a precise way), or is a small
    test case for a specific combination of features.  Notolab will also report
    if your test is a duplicate with any existing within our test suite. If this
    happens, we would like you to add to or modify your test to make it unique.
    However, we will not be grading the interesting-ness of your tests at this
    point in the semester.
