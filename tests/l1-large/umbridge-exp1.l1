// The tests you write for 15-411 will all go in this directory. The
// tests we write will all be provided to you through the public course
// repository in the directory ../../tests.

// The first line in this file means that the testing harness will
// expect this to be a file that compiles and returns 1.

    int x = 256;  // 2^8 
    x *= x;       // 2^16
    x *= x;       // 2^32 ==> the value of x is 0
    x %= x;       // raise div-by-zero here

// Read the handout and look at the files in ../../tests/l1-basic
