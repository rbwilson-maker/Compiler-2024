//test error
int main() {
    The autograder subtracts 5 points for each required test category that you
    have less than 2 tests in, and subtracts 2 points for each 'bad' test. It
    adds 1 point for each 'good' test. The lower bound is 0. So all it means is
    that you'll need more tests for it to start showing points.
