Long ago, the four courses lived together in harmony.
Then, everything changed when daddy Gupta attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all four courses, could
stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.
122 years passed and my brother and I discovered the new
Avatar, an assbuster named Pk, and although his assbusting
skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready
to bust anyone. But I believe Pk can bust the world.
