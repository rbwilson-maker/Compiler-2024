Reptile - Periphery
In here, a tale of a boy who reached the masses
His name was Billy and he liked to get high
A normal guy 'til the green-skin apocalypse
A do-or-die
There must be something in the water
Where he lie, where he lie
He threw that gaping brain asunder
When he realized, when he realized
It's coming down
Yeah
We've sown thrones and brought the kings down to knees
Hello, here we are, salutations
And every day that you wake s a gift that you take from the gods
That's right
You came from the trees and we altered the genes
Here you are, all you fuck with is wages
You had the day, but you pissed it away
I think it's time that we show our ways
Now shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets, whoa
From mountain tops to ocean
We own your every need
It's coming down
With every breath that we take, we can hear that sound
Somebody needs a reaction to stay on the ground
With every breath that we take, we can hear that sound
A green-skin apocalypse
A do-or-die
So Billy heeds the call of fathers
Release high
Through these eyes, shit
Embraces the chi and he praises the weeds
Holding out for the day he can face them
Every day that he trains is a slap in the face to the gods
God damn
Shutting out politics
Viewing beings as equals
Ain't it funny how that makes sense?
You had the floor, but you gave it a bore
Now it's equal
Can we clean that slate?
Now shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets (whoa)
From mountain tops to ocean
We own your every need
It's coming down
Somebody needs a reaction to stay on the ground
It's coming down
Yeah
What's up, London?
Follow a trail of the ones who bleed the masses
Follow behind the reptilian eyes
A normal day in the green-skin apocalypse
A do-or-die
We'll be here summertime at Download
Who's coming?
Fucking who's coming?
He threw that gaping brain asunder
When he realized, when he realized
National alliance and he leads the fight
No class, no race, just fucking violence in their eyes
A plan for human survival takes to flight
The good that's left and all we cherish stands to die
Is this the end of all we know?
They all float, whoa
Is this the end of all we know?
Wasted our lives for what? Whoa
Make some fucking noise
Float away
Do we feed the reaction?
Do we stay?
Do we all float away?
Everybody make some fucking noise
Do you think you know who you are?
Did you think you had it all worked out, well?
Who could believe
Those dead-eyed soldiers?
Red sky rainfall
The winter beams no beauty
Just cold-eyed monsters and bare branches
You can wail to the moon
That'll just make things worse
They see you, they see me, they see all
No children in the streets
Where do they play when
Freedom here has been revoked?
The ground which all their fathers soaked
No medicine
The scarcity of nourishment is evident
And where's our god?
Have we seen that side of heaven yet? No
Rich, poor
Clutching to their sheets in horror
Is there an answer? (No)
Is there somebody who can take away
All our present dismay?
Bury the light
Pray through night
Mayhem in the streets
No order
Is there an answer? (No)
Is there somebody who can take away
All our present dismay?
Bury the light
Pray through night
You've buried that, buried that light
Now pray through night
What has come down
Is littered all around in your sight
It's littered in your sight
The claim they stake
A land from us, they take
The claim they stake (they stake)
A land from us, they take (they take)
The craft he shakes
A race within his wake
Victory alone became his above the soil we know
A grave is laid
A man within his cage
Victory alone became his down in the soil he owns
Soil we know becomes our own home
Soil we know becomes our own home
Now we're staring at the ground together
This is not the first time or the last time
Soil we know becomes our own home
Now we're staring at the ground together
Now we're staring at the ground together
Soil we own becomes ours
(Order back in what we know)
Soil we own becomes ours
Now one with the soil we own
Soil we own becomes ours
(Order back in what we know)
Soil we own becomes ours
Now one with the soil we, soil we own
Hey
