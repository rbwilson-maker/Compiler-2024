 *
 * This test tests that the loop variable is properly modified by an assignemnt.
 * In this case, someone is attempting to compute the difference between the sum
 * and product of the absolute values of the number in the range [-1024, 1024].
 * However, they mistakenly modify the loop variable by taking the absolute
 * value when it's negative, leading to an infinite loop.
