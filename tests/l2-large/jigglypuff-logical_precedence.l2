 *
 * This test exercises the operator precedence defined by the C0 language.
 * Specifically, it tests a weird case of the precedence that leads to a
 * syntax error. The equality and disequality operators have precedence
 * over all bitwise operations, so a comparison with a bitwise expression
 * using equality will cause an error due a integer and boolean expression
 * being &'ed.
