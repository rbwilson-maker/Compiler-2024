Obviously, I was on the right track. It was also obvious that
the English-speaking world was not yet inordinately interested in
protracted palindromes and, in truth, neither was 1. Over the next
five years I devoted an evening or two each month to enlarging
the composition. Even tua lly, I added another 377 words, and sent
the result to the Guinness Book of World Records. To my astonishment they declared me the world recordholder for the year 1975.
As champion, I didn I t rest on my laurels; on the other hand,
I didn I t pursue the subsequent recordholders with marked assiduity.
In 1980 I had reached all of 18,000 words when I suddenly realized the futility of proceeding along that line of palindromania.
I could go on forever and would always end up with virtually nothing. A formless monster of dismaying length, a rodent in a squirrel
cage, going nowhere very rapidly and very tediously, and ending
up exactly where he started I
Over a period of time, the idea of writing a palindromic novel
replaced the fruitless pursuit of mere length. When I fully accepted, I stopped adding to the endless word game and for a year
or so considered the novelistic possibilities. If anything, I realized the enormity of the task, and decided to concentrate as much
time and effort as I could spare. Approximately four hours of work
per day went into the effort, or about 100 hours per month. I completed the novel in five months.
As in all palindromes, impeccable honesty was essential. One
must not cheat by inventing words or commg new spellings. During the first days I wanted to be a purist. Use only common English words was the dictum: no variable spellings, no oddments,
no obscure names of places or peoples, no obsolete words, no foreign phrases or Latinisms masquerading as good English. But of
course this was all quite impossible. I soon settled down to the
best I could do with the English approved by fifteen dictionaries,
encyclopedias and other reference volumes for the final verdict
on the existence and spelling of unusual words.
On the other hand, I was extremely cautious with alternative
spellings, for example using or rather than our in labor, honor,
etc. 1 almost always chose the American rather than the English
spellings in such words as woolen and traveler. I was likeWise
cautious on the alternative spellings of place names such as Surinam/Suriname, Nineveh/Ninevah, etc. I a Iso made use of occ asional
abbreviations, but these, for the most part, were in common usage:

But all writers of palindromes realize that it is in the short
effort that the whole is the final beauty:

MURDER? NOT SO. BOSTON RED RUM

Yet it is also eviden.t that in a protracted palindrome the parts
become the reigning interest; and although the whole is a colossus
to be admired and honored, the parts are the links of the marathon
chain composed of spliced emordnilaps that run to the exact center
of the palindrome where, on the other side, the emordnilaps continue with their new sense to the completion of the palindrome.
Which brings us to that perfect word which will one day certainly find its way into the English lexicon. Emordnilap is a fine inversion or reverse spelling of palindrome. Who first thought of
it? And how long ago? Emordnilap is the perfect designation for
a word, phrase or sentence that makes different sense when read
backwards:
ED, I CLASP MURFREESBORO

0, ROB SEER FRUMPS, ALCIDE!

SOT! TO TASTE VICTUAL MUFFINS, I DO SO SNIFF ARABLE GUMS.

SMUG ELBA! R.A.F. FINS? 0, SOD! I SNIFF UMLAUT CIVETS AT OTTO'S.

BOSNIA PAIN! A MONOMANIA PETAL! LIES! 0 RARE WOMAN AMONG ANIMALS!

SLAM! I NAG NO MAN! A MOWER AROSE ILL, ATE PAIN, A MONOMANIA PAIN - SOB!

Thus, ineVitably, and because he has no choice, the composer
of a palindromic novel becomes a tailor of words. He lays out hundreds of small emordnilaps, and stitches them all together in their
assigned places, with the finished product the gigantic palindrome
that forms the whole work. And the exact center becomes the hinge
of the composition while, irrevocably, the story on both sides must
proceed to its destined end, quite as if the hinge were nonexistent.
It was the hinge that created for me the principal problem of the
novel.
It is evident that 1 had to keep constantly in mind two elements:
(l) palindrome-emornilap, and (2) development of the story. I had
little trouble mapping out the argument. The title, Dr. Awkward
& Olson in ..Oslo, were two names removed from a previous palindrome, and they gave me instant inspiration. The book, 1 decided,
would be a modern morality play in the form of a detective-chase
novel. It would be a contest between Dr. Awkward, a man of unrelieved vice, criminality, corruption and knavery, the avatar of
absolute immorality on earth, and Olson in Oslo, the manifestation
of human goodness and moral eloquence, a strong wise old graySAID DIAS

The plot involves a bumbling private eye, Sam X. Xmas, and
his inamorata, Mabel E. Bam, who with eleven of their close associates succeed (with the conspicuous help of Olson) in tracking
down and bringing Dr. Awkward to justice. After decades of malefaction, the man of monstrous evil wi 11 no longer pollute the p lanet. A plot, 1 thought, that was simple and straightforward - and
highly moral. But now, determined to construct the palindromic
novel, 1 found myself on shifting ground. 1 quickly realized that
even a solid schema was only the beginning. I needed dialogue,
action and whatever character development 1 could manage. I realized that a palindromic novel as a fast read, with pace, excitement and a believable plot with a slam-bang finish was a most
distant possibility. Palindromes of great length do not lend themselves to simplicity. The word simplicity itself is fatal. To say
SNAPS & SPANS is not the same as saying PAP, Sl RE. PAP'S A PAP
FOE, DAMN ITI TIN MADE OF PAPA'S PAPER IS PAP. The first is
almost meaningless; the second is alive with possibilities.
To my great good fortune 1 discovered the grand stratagem. Willy-nilly, I fell upon the contrivance used by artists and poets
from earliest times to modern Joyce: the free association of ideas.
I decided that throughout the novel I would make constant allusion
to a miscellany of curios, but make them as natural as possible,
and always consistent with the flow of the story. Dialogue would
become chaotic, images arise from nowhere, allusions and illusions
drift nonsyntactical1y from here to there, and at last resolve, as
they must, into the immediacy of the plot. This was certainly
not at variance with the complexities of everyday thought and activity, where it is the rare individual who passes through an entire day without momentary disorders of reflection, disconnection
of ideas, and confused impingements on the essential orderof things.

Thus every character speaks a private tongue that often has
the most tenuous relationship to the conversation or problem at
hand. Yet these characters do not spout nonsense. Each aside, each
digression, each stream of conscious or unconscious babble leads
to the resolution of a problem or a reflection. Dialogue is often
like the fractured, tortuous dreams of sleep where events occur
with only the frailest conjunction with what has passed. But words
are bricks, and some are mortar, and both are masoned into place
by the author who a lone knows the scenario and the path he is
taking, and that each digression contributes to the forward movement of the story, and to the validity of the emordnilaps that occur
dozens of pages in the future.

The novel is replete with like eccentric ities, dottiness, oddities,
a veritable circus of them. There is an endless succession of oafish blunders and clumsy performances. Each persona is a pali ndromic grotesque, in character as well as name:

Otto 1. Giotto Oleg N. Angelo

Toi let Eliot Evita Dative
Lisa B. Basil Parcel E. Crap

And scores of others.
They are all showoffs, punsters, exhibit ion ists, masters of logomachy and periphrasis. They swas,hbuckle even in sleep. They are
not verbal tricksters - it is their only mode of speech. The inversion of phrases, the syntactical upsidedownness, the swarms of
ideas, the interest in every singularity about them are made as
natural as possible, consistent with the flow of the story. And,
to one's surprise, the eccentric soon becomes the commonplace, and
the reader, to his pleasant confoundment, accepts the strangeness
as the norm. Or so one hopes.

But eventually we reach a crisis. Midway in the novel, as in
every palindrome, a point is reached beyond which there is no
return, except to back track, letter by letter, to the exact iota
of the beginning. lt is the point of the hinge. It is, in sum, the
precise spot where the forward half of the palindrome begins to
recite itself backward, and the backward half becomes the forward.
ln the novel, it occurs on page 83. Dr. Awkward, imprisoned, raves
and mewls at his unaccustomed situation - and the center of the
universe becomes his own name.

Thus, here., at last, the novel breasts its divide and plunges
on to its foretold conclusion. The plot marches forward. Dr. Awkward is tried, justiced. He is convicted, condemned. He is shipped
to a far Helena in the mid-Pacific, and the planet breathes easier.
