/*
    I was at the interview for a job as a TA for 15-411 Compiler Design. As soon
    as I walked in, Jan told me, "You know what? For every month in the year -
    of which there are twelve - I have met an applicant who was born in that
    month." He seemed proud of his achievement. "Enough chitchat," he continued,
    although I have not yet spoken a word, "Let's begin the interview."

    I do not know what, if there were any, his intent was behind that
    information, but I could tell he has quite a lot of applicants. But how many
    exactly? The answer obviously has to be at least twelve, but twenty? Or
    maybe thirty? Or perhaps even more? What is the expected number of
    applicants he has talked to so far? To estimate my Teaching Assistantship
    prospects, I decided to tackle this problem.
