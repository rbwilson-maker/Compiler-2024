           An implementation of top-down splaying with sizes
             D. Sleator <sleator@cs.cmu.edu>, January 1994.
        
  This extends top-down-splay.c to maintain a size field in each node.
  This is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted there.  This makes
  it possible to efficiently compute the rank of a key.  (The rank is
  the number of nodes to the left of the given key.)  It it also
  possible to quickly find the node of a given rank.  Both of these
  operations are illustrated in the code below. The remainder of this
  introduction is taken from top-down-splay.c.

  "Splay trees", or "self-adjusting search trees" are a simple and
  efficient data structure for storing an ordered set.  The data
  structure consists of a binary tree, with no additional fields.  It
  allows searching, insertion, deletion, deletemin, deletemax,
  splitting, joining, and many other operations, all with amortized
  logarithmic performance.  Since the trees adapt to the sequence of
  requests, their performance on real access patterns is typically even
  better.  Splay trees are described in a number of texts and papers
  [1,2,3,4].

  The code here is adapted from simple top-down splay, at the bottom of
  page 669 of [2].  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from
  spade.pc.cs.cmu.edu in directory /usr/sleator/public.

  The chief modification here is that the splay operation works even if the
  item being splayed is not in the tree, and even if the tree root of the
  tree is NULL.  So the line:

                              t = splay(i, t);*

  causes it to search for item with key i in the tree rooted at t.  If it's
  there, it is splayed to the root.  If it isn't there, then the node put
  at the root is the last one before NULL that would have been reached in a
  normal binary search for i.  (It's a neighbor of i in the tree.)  This
  allows many other operations to be easily implemented, as shown below.

  The following code was written by Daniel Sleator, and is released
  in the public domain. 

  * It was modified to the language L4 by the 15-411 course staff,
  attempting to preserve the spirit of Danny's original implementation
  as much as is feasible. L4's restrictions regarding large types on the
  stack has reduced some of the elegance, but not the amortized logarithmic
  behavior!
