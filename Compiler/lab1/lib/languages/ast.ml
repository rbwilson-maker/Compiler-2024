(* Notice that the subexpressions of an expression are marked.
 * (That is, the subexpressions are of type exp Mark.t, not just
 * type exp.) This means that source code location (a src_span) is
 * associated with the subexpression. Currently, the typechecker uses
 * this source location to print more helpful error messages.
 *
 * It's the parser and lexer's job to associate src_span locations with each
 * ast. It's instructive, but not necessary, to closely read the source code
 * for c0_parser.mly, c0_lexer.mll, and parse.ml to get a good idea of how
 * src_spans are created.
 *
 * Check out the Mark module for ways of converting a marked expression into
 * the original expression or to the src_span location. You could also just
 * look at how the typechecker gets the src_span from an expression when it
 * prints error messages.
 *
 * It's completely possible to remove Marks entirely from your compiler, but
 * it will be harder to figure out typechecking errors for later labs.
