 ** Usage **

There are exactly 3 ways to run the client. All args must be in the exact order, and all args
not in brackets MUST be specified.

Send a job : 
  [-ne] -j loaderNum -r resources... -m methodname -a args...
Make a new loader : 
  -n loaderNum -r resources...
Exit server : 
  --exit-server

** Sending a Job **
  

  -ne             Do not emulate the remote job (always exit 0)

  -j loaderNum    Send the job to remote loader <loaderNum>
  -r resources... Attach resources to the remote job that is local only to the job
  -m methodname   Specifies the method we will run. Follows the signature 
                      <packagepath>.<ClassName>#<methodName> 
                  where the method is of type 
                    methodName : String[] -> void

  -a args...      Args to be sent to the job when invoked

  Emulation : 
  If the -ne is NOT specified, we emulate the remote job, meaning we 
  exit with the same exit value as the remote job. If the remote job exits on an 
  exception, we exit with exit code 1

** Makine a New Loader **
  
  -n loaderNum    Makes a new loader under remote loader <loaderNum> 
  -r resources... Attach resources to the loader


** Special Details **
  :: When the client disconnects, we IMMEDIATELY KILL the remote job and all of its subprocesses
  :: When the client attempts to make a new job on a loader does not exist, we will wait for the loader to be created
     by another client call. If the loader is never created, the client attempting to make the job on the 
     non-existant loader will wait indefinitely
